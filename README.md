Lease abstraction using GPT, Pinecone and Langchain:

This project was related to lease abstraction AI with the help of generative AI. For this project I utilized vector Database search aligned with LLM and Langchain. The LLM I utilized is GPT-3 and the vector database I utilized is pinecone. 

Meme Creation using GPT, MidJourney and Dall-E:

This project is related to Meme Creation website with the help of generative AI based architectures such as MidJourney, GPT-3 and Dall-E. This project is also an upwork project and can be seen here:

Playground Clone using GPT and Flask:

This project is a Prompt Response Generation website just like OPENAI playground. Following were the main parts that I completed regarding GPT-3

â€¢	OPENAI GPT-3 API Implementation
â€¢	OPENAI  GPT-3 Parameter Testing
â€¢	OPENAI  GPT-3 Prompt Engineering
â€¢	OPENAI  GPT-3 Fine tuning.
â€¢	OPENAI  GPT-3 Application Development
The project can be seen here:
https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~019fb853d89f255d48
Another project is the one I developed related to blog generation using GPT-3. 
The main skills that were used in these project are as follows:
â€¢	OPENAI based all GPT Architectures
â€¢	LangChain and Pinecone
â€¢	Hugging Face Transformers
â€¢	NLP
â€¢	Flask Web Development
â€¢	HTML, CSS & Bootstrap based development
â€¢	MYSQL
â€¢	API development
â€¢	Docker
I have also strong knowledge about GIT, Docker, AWS, Heroku and Azure if it is required during the project.
